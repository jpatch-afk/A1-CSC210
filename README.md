Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

This was certainly very difficult. I am still a bit rusty with my Java experience, but I was able to access some of the old PowerPoint lectures and some of my old notes from last Fall, so I was able to figure it out. Going to office hours was also very helpful. I feel like I have a better handle on how some of the aspects of Java that I take for granted work.
